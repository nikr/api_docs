Webhooks API
============

Use the webhooks API to manage callback requests that you wish to receive on the following types of events:

| Name                      | ID                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Person created            | `person_created`      |
| Person changed            | `person_changed`      |
| Person contacted          | `person_contacted`    |
| Person destroyed          | `person_destroyed`    |
| Person tagged             | `person_tagged`       |
| Person untagged           | `person_untagged`     |
| Person merged             | `person_merged`       |
| People destroyed in batch | `people_destroyed`    |
| Donation succeeded        | `donation_succeeded`  |
| Donation changed          | `donation_changed`    |
| Donation canceled         | `donation_canceled`   |

Each webhook instance has a single URL and event type. A webhook sends an HTTP POST with a message body containing data about the person or donation created. The POST is sent to the URL whenever the event occurs.
