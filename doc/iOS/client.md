# Using the Client

The client layer of the SDK is the lowest layer. It contains the bare
essentials, mainly NBClient and NBAuthenticator. You can [use this layer
alone][installing selectively] if this fits your use case. However, it is more
common to use the higher-level [accounts layer][]. Read on to learn more about
what NBClient and NBAuthenticator can do.

## NBClient

The base layer of the SDK is NBClient. In order for the client to do anything
with a nation, it needs: 1. the nation slug and 2. a valid API key (access
token).

```objectivec
#import <NBClient/NBClient.h>
// ...
NSString *nationSlug = @"abeforprez";
NSString *testToken = @"somehash";
NBClient *client = [[NBClient alloc] initWithNationSlug:nationSlug
                                                 apiKey:testToken
                                                                                           customBaseURL:nil
                                                                                                                                  customURLSession:nil
                                                                                                                                                            customURLSessionConfiguration:nil]];
                                                                                                                                                            ```

                                                                                                                                                            The above will create a valid client that has its own NSURLSession. With it, you
                                                                                                                                                            can now fetch data from the nation through predefined methods that correspond
                                                                                                                                                            with API endpoints. All client methods for API endpoints accept completion
                                                                                                                                                            handlers that will get passed: 1. the data as one or many items (if any), 2. the
                                                                                                                                                            pagination info (if relevant), and 3. the error (if any).

## NBAuthenticator

Unless using a predefined token, you'll need to authenticate with the
NationBuilder API via OAuth 2. NBAuthenticator simplifies the process. It
supports the token and password-grant-type flows.

The token flow is where the authentication requires visiting the nation in
Safari. And it is the suggested approach. The password-grant-type flow is
discouraged and only intended if your app is to be used by only your own nation.

The authenticator needs to know the OAuth Client ID for your NationBuilder app.
Like the client, it will also need the nation slug in the form of the base URL.

```objectivec
#import <NBAuthenticator/NBAuthenticator.h>
#import <NBClient/NBClient.h>
// ...
NSString *nationSlug = @"abeforprez";
NSString *clientIdentifier = @"somehash";
NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:NBClientDefaultBaseURLFormat, nationSlug]];
NBAuthenticator *authenticator = [[NBAuthenticator alloc] initWithBaseURL:baseURL
                                                         clientIdentifier:clientIdentifier];
                                                         // Now we can create the client.
                                                         NBClient *client = [[NBClient alloc] initWithNationSlug:nationSlug
                                                                                                   authenticator:authenticator
                                                                                                                                          customURLSession:nil
                                                                                                                                                                    customURLSessionConfiguration:nil]];
                                                                                                                                                                    ```

                                                                                                                                                                    You will also need to add your NationBuilder app's redirect URI to your application info plist:

                                                                                                                                                                    `com.nationbuilder.oauth` (known as `NBAuthenticationRedirectURLIdentifier`).

                                                                                                                                                                    2. Also under `URL types` add an array `URL Schemes`. In it, add an item that is the

                                                                                                                                                                    has the protocol `sample-app.nationbuilder`.

                                                                                                                                                                    Now to authenticate, provide the authenticator with the redirect path and a

## NBClientDelegate

NBClient has a delegate protocol that your classes can implement to get
additional control over default client functionality:

```objectivec
// Continuing.
@interface MYAppDelegate () <NBClientDelegate>
// ...
client.delegate = self;
```

### Custom Error Handling

NBClient by default checks for errors and generates NSError objects: 1. errors
from data task or JSON parsing failures, 2. API errors with non-successful http
status codes, 3. API errors with successful http status codes. 

The delegate protocol's `-client:shouldHandleResponse:forRequest:*` methods
allow you to halt default response handling at most errors. By default, these
methods, if implemented, should return `YES`. For example, the accounts layer
uses the `withHTTPError` variant to automatically sign out of the account that
has the client:

```objectivec
// Continuing.
- (BOOL)client:(NBClient *)client shouldHandleResponse:(NSHTTPURLResponse *)response
                                            forRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request
                                                                                     withHTTPError:(NSError *)error
                                                                                     {
                                                                                           // Check the request if needed. Here, we want this to apply to all requests.
                                                                                               if (response.statusCode == 401 && client.apiKey) {
                                                                                                         NBLogInfo(@"Account reported as unauthorized, access token: %@", client.apiKey);
                                                                                                                 // Tear down the account and prevent the default response handling of calling
                                                                                                                         // the original completion handler (ie. one that displays the error)...
                                                                                                                                 return NO;
                                                                                                                                     }
                                                                                                                                         return YES;
                                                                                     }
                                                                                     ```

### Custom Data Handling

NBClient will look for predefined keys in the JSON data and return the value as
either `item` or `items`. The key varies with the client method. For example,
person methods use the `person` key, while people methods use the `results` key.
If the key is not found, or if the error `code` and `message` are found, an
error is returned instead. Consult the specific [API documentation][] section
for details.

  For instance, consider the possibility of the API changing to return data using
  new keys and NBClient being not updated to look for these keys. You can get this
  additional data via the delegate's `-client:didParseJSON:fromResponse:forRequest:`.

### Custom Request Handling

NBClient will build NSMutableURLRequests with a timeout of 10s. It will use the
protocol cache policy, except for fetch requests that use
`NSURLRequestReloadRevalidatingCacheData`. It will also set the request headers
per API requirements.

The NSURLSessionDataTasks created from these requests are subsequently started.
If you don't want the tasks to start automatically, instead of suspending the
task when the client method returns it, just implement
`-client:shouldAutomaticallyStartDataTask:` to return `NO`.

Also, for instance, consider the possibility of the API changing to accept
additional headers and NBClient being not updated to include these headers when
needed. You can add these headers via the delegate protocol's
`-client:willCreateDataTaskForRequest:`

respective NBClient methods reflect this need by working with `NBPaginationInfo`
objects. NBPaginationInfo is a simple data structure that simplifies working
with the API-specific pagination keys. 

We suggest using NBPaginationInfo in your data sources and table and collection
views. It also provides helpers for computing UI-related pagination values.
You'll need to create them when working with certain endpoints:

```objectivec
// Data source...
- (instancetype)initWithClient:(NBClient *)client
{
      self = [super init];
          if (self) {
                    self.client = client;
                            self.paginationInfo = [[NBPaginationInfo alloc] initWithDictionary:nil legacy:YES];
                                }
                                    return self;
}
// ...
[self.client fetchPeopleWithPaginationInfo:self.paginationInfo
 completionHandler:^(NSArray *items, NBPaginationInfo *paginationInfo, NSError *error) {
        // ...
             self.paginationInfo = paginationInfo
                  NSArray *people = [self.class parseClientResults:items];
                       if (self.paginationInfo.currentPageNumber > 1) {
                                  self.people = [self.people arrayByAddingObjectsFromArray:people];
                                       } else {
                                                  self.people = people;
                                                       }
                                                        }];
                                                        ```

                                                        __Note:__ NBPaginationInfo has a `legacy` flag that you can flip to allow the
                                                        API to take in and return legacy pagination keys. We discourage using the legacy
                                                        NationBuilder API pagination. We deprecated it, except for test tokens and older
                                                        applications. Eventually, we will fully deprecate and stop supporting it. We
                                                        suggest using the new token-based pagination.

### NSURLSession

NBClient's NSURLSession defaults to using `+defaultSessionConfiguration`, but
with a custom NSURLCache with 4mb memory and 20mb disk capacities, stored at the
`<nationSlug>.nationbuilder.com` application subdirectory. You can override the
session or the configuration by passing during initialization either a
`customURLSession` or `customURLSessionConfiguration`, respectively.

### NBLogging

Both NBClient and NBAuthenticator implement `NBLogging` (see `NBDefines.h`),
which means they support the log levels defined in `NBLogLevel`. For example,
the default debug-build-configuration log level is `NBLogLevelInfo`, but for
NBClient you might want to set the class log level to `NBLogLevelWarning`
(`[NBClient updateLoggingToLevel:NBLogLevelWarning]`), so it doesn't log each
request and response.

### NSError

Both NBClient and NBAuthenticator have their own error codes for many of the
errors passed into their methods' completion handlers. All errors originating
from SDK code is under the `NBErrorDomain` domain.
