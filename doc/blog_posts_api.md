Match Endpoint
--------------
Map an external service id to a NationBuilder blog post id
GET /api/v1/sites/:site_slug/pages/blogs/:blog_id/posts/match

### Attributes
* external_id - the external id

### Example
I have a wordpress blog that I have imported into NationBuilder via this API, and I want to edit one of the posts that was imported, to which I had attached the external id "wp_1234".  To edit the page I need the NationBuilder id, but I did not write it down.  To overcome this lack of information I can issue a request like this:

```
GET https://foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/blogs/13/posts/match?external_id=wp_1234
```

And get back a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": 15
}
```

Show Endpoint
-------------
Show the details of an individual blog post, including the content after the page change
GET /api/v1/sites/:site_slug/pages/blogs/:blog_id/posts/:id

### Example

When you make a request like this:

```
GET https:///foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/pages/blogs/10/posts/11
```

Then you should get a 200 response with a body like this:

```json
{
  "blog_post": {
    "slug": "perspective_misalignments",
    "status": "published",
    "author_id": 5,
    "site_slug": "foobar",

    "id": 11,
    "content_before_flip": "<p>Some people just don't see eye to eye</p>",
    "content_after_flip": "<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>",
    "external_id": nil,
