Note: When updating a survey, Nested resources such as questions and choices are updated, created, or deleted according to the following rules:

* Existing nested resources not mentioned in the response body will be deleted.
* Nested resource is updated if an `id` attribute is supplied and the nested resource is found in your nation's database.
* If a nested resource has an `id` attribute specified but is not found in your nation's database, the API call will fail and respond with status code 404.
* The nested resource is created if no `id` attribute is supplied.


You will get a response with code 200 like this:

Survey Response Creation Endpoint
---------------------------------

Use this endpoint to register the responses a person has to a survey.  The answers will be attached to their profile page.

Note: Answering questions requires the surveyed person to have a first name and last name recorded.  If the person record does not have this information attached, a validation error will be returned from this call.

POST /api/v1/survey_responses


### Parameters

#### Survey Response Parameters
* `survey_id` - id of the survey the person answered
* `person_id` - id of the person who answered the survey
* `question_responses` - an array of objects representing the responses to individual questions that the surveyed person provided

#### Question Response Parameters
* `question_id` - id of the question being answered
* `response` - the response provided to the question. Response can be a string or id.  If the survey question being responded to is a multiple choice question, the response will be the choice with the id provided.  If the question is a yes/no question, then the response can be either "yes" or "no".  If the question is a text question, the response will be stored as the provided string.

### Example

```
POST https://foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/survey_responses
```

```json
{
  "survey_response": {
    "survey_id": 1,
    "person_id": 19,

    }, {
      "question_id": 12093814100,

    }]

}
```

The survey response will be made, and you should receive a response with status 200 and body like this:
